#Write a python program with nested decision structures that perform the following: 
#If amount1 is greater than 10 and amount2 is less than 100, display the greater of amount1 and amount2

#amount1 > 10 and amount2 < 100, then compare the 2
#Take user input for assigning values to variables 'amount1' and 'amount2'
amount1=int(input("Enter a value here: "))
amount2=int(input("Enter a value here: "))
print("amount1=",amount1)
print("amount1=",amount2)

#Imagine an alien was just shot down in a game. 
#Create a variable called alien_color and assign it a value of 'green', 'yellow', or 'red'.

#•Write an if statement to test whether the alien’s color is green. If it is, print a message that the player just earned 5 points.
#•Write one version of this program that passes the if test and another that fails. (The version that fails will have no output.)

alien_color="yellow"
if alien_color=="green" :
    print=("That is correct! You have just earned yourself five extra points!")
else :
    print=("That is incorrect! That is not the color of the alien.")

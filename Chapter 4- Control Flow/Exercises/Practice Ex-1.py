#Write a python program with if statement that assigns 20 to the variable y and assigns 40 to the
#variable z if the variable & is greater than 100.

#take input from user and store in a variable called 'var'
var=int(input("Enter a number of your choice: "))

#write an if statement where:
#if var>100, y=20 and z=40
if var>100:
    y=20
    z=40
    print("y =",y,"\nz =",z)

#Stripping names
#Use a variable to represent a person’s name, and include some whitespace characters at the beginning and end of the name. Make sure you use each character combination, “\t” and “\n”, at least once.
#Print the name once, so the whitespace around the name is displayed. 
#Then print the name using each of the three stripping functions, lstrip(), rstrip(), and strip().

name = "\tAisha\t"
print(name)
print ("My name is" , name , "and I am a first year student.")

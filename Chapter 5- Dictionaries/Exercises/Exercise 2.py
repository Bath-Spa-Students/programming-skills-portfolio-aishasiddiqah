#A Python dictionary can be used to model an actual dictionary. 
#However, to avoid confusion, let’s call it a glossary.

#* Think of five programming words you’ve learned about in the previous chapters. 
#Use these words as the keys in your glossary, and store their meanings as values.

#* Print each word and its meaning as neatly formatted output. 
#You might print the word followed by a colon and then its meaning, or print the word on one line and then print its meaning indented on a second line. 
#Use the newline character (\n) to insert a blank line between each word-meaning pair in your output.

            'integer' : 'a number that does not contain a decimal point',
            'input' : 'a function where the user is required to enter data',
            'tuple' : 'a data type which is similar to lists and stores multiple data values, but is immutable'

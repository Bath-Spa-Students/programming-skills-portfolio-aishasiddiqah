#Strings Concatination
#Write three strings in different variables and print the output as one string.

str_1= "Welcome,"
str_2= "how may I"
str_3= "help you?"
print(str_1 , str_2 , str_3)

#can also substitute (,) with (+)
#the only difference will be that when you use (,) there is an automatic space before the next word
#but if (+) is used, then there is no extra space and the two are connected
#for example
# a=volley 
# b=ball
# the output of print(a,b) will be 'volley ball'
# the output of print(a+b) will be 'volleyball'
